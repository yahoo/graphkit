Lightweight computation graphs for Python
-----------------------------------------

GraphKit is a lightweight Python module for creating and running ordered graphs of computations, where the nodes of the graph correspond to computational operations, and the edges correspond to output --> input dependencies between those operations.  Such graphs are useful in computer vision, machine learning, and many other domains.

.. _quick-start:

Quick start
-----------

Here's how to install::

   pip install graphkit

OR with dependencies for plotting support (and you need to install `Graphviz
<https://graphviz.org>`_ program separately with your OS tools)::

   pip install graphkit[plot]


Here's a Python script with an example GraphKit computation graph that produces multiple outputs (``a * b``, ``a - a * b``, and ``abs(a - a * b) ** 3``)::

   from operator import mul, sub
   from graphkit import compose, operation

   # Computes |a|^p.
   def abspow(a, p):
      c = abs(a) ** p
      return c

   # Compose the mul, sub, and abspow operations into a computation graph.
   graphop = compose(name="graphop")(
      operation(name="mul1", needs=["a", "b"], provides=["ab"])(mul),
      operation(name="sub1", needs=["a", "ab"], provides=["a_minus_ab"])(sub),
      operation(name="abspow1", needs=["a_minus_ab"], provides=["abs_a_minus_ab_cubed"], params={"p": 3})(abspow)
   )

   # Run the graph-operation and request all of the outputs.
   out = graphop({'a': 2, 'b': 5})

   # Prints "{'a': 2, 'a_minus_ab': -8, 'b': 5, 'ab': 10, 'abs_a_minus_ab_cubed': 512}".
   print(out)

   # Run the graph-operation and request a subset of the outputs.
   out = graphop({'a': 2, 'b': 5}, outputs=["a_minus_ab"])

   # Prints "{'a_minus_ab': -8}".
   print(out)

As you can see, any function can be used as an operation in GraphKit, even ones imported from system modules!


.. _plotting:

Plotting
--------

For debugging the above graph-operation you may plot the *execution plan*
of the last computation it using these methods::

   graphop.plot(show=True)                # open a matplotlib window
   graphop.plot("intro.svg")              # other supported formats: png, jpg, pdf, ...
   graphop.plot()                         # without arguments return a pydot.DOT object
   graphop.plot(solution=out)             # annotate graph with solution values

.. image:: images/intro.svg
    :alt: Intro graph

.. figure:: images/GraphkitLegend.svg
   :alt:  Graphkit Legend

   The legend for all graphkit diagrams, generated by :func:`graphkit.plot.legend()`.

.. Tip::
   The `pydot.Dot <https://pypi.org/project/pydot/>`_ instances returned by ``plot()``
   are rendered directly in *Jupyter/IPython* notebooks as SVG images.

.. NOTE::
   For plots, `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org>`_ program must be in your PATH,
   and ``pydot`` & ``matplotlib`` python packages installed.
   You may install both when installing ``graphkit`` with its ``plot`` extras::

      pip install graphkit[plot]
